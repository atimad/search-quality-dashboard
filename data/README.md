## Data Format

The synthetic search logs include:
- `session_id`: Unique identifier for user session
- `user_id`: Anonymized user identifier
- `query_id`: Unique identifier for each query
- `query_text`: The search query text
- `timestamp`: When the query was executed
- `results`: List of result IDs returned
- `clicked_results`: List of result IDs that were clicked
- `click_timestamps`: Timestamps for each click
- `device_type`: User device (mobile, desktop, tablet)

## Usage

Data files in this directory are automatically generated by running:

```bash
python init.py
```

You can customize the data generation with various parameters:

```bash
# Generate a full dataset
python init.py --num-users 1000 --num-days 30

# Generate a small sample dataset for testing
python init.py --sample --sample-size 1000
```

## Note

This directory is initially empty in the repository. The data files will be generated locally when you run the initialization script and are not checked into version control.
